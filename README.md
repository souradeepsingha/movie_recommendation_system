Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:


- **kaggle**- In this web app first i collect the data from kaggle.com the data is .csv file 
-  **jupyter noebook** -In this project i use Jupyter Notebook for analysing the data,cleaning the data and preprocessing the data.For this process  atfirst i import the python libraries 
**a**.Pandas
**b**.Numpy
**c**.Matplotlib
**d**.Seaborn
after that i build the machine using python libraries
**a**.Sklearn
**b**.nltk
- then i dumb it in pickle file useing **pickle library** and pickle file waa created
- then i use **streamlit library** for create a web app and i create the phototype of that web app using steamlit
